00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,140

2
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,030
Hi.

3
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:03,740
Today, we're going to do a
really fun problem called

4
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:05,520
geniuses and chocolates.

5
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,380
And what this problem is
exercising is your knowledge

6
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:12,230
of properties of probability
laws.

7
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:15,340
So let me just clarify
what I mean by that.

8
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:18,160
Hopefully, by this point, you
have already learned what the

9
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,980
axioms of probability are.

10
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:25,290
And properties of probability
laws are essentially any rules

11
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:27,880
that you can derive
from those axioms.

12
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:31,760
So take for example the fact
that the probability of A

13
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,830
union B is equal to the
probability of A plus the

14
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:37,640
probability of B minus the
probability of the

15
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,700
intersection.

16
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,450
That's an example of a property
of a probability law.

17
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:44,860
So enough with the preamble.

18
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:47,930
Let's see what the problem
is asking us.

19
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:51,040
In this problem, we have
a class of students.

20
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:55,610
And we're told that 60% of the
students are geniuses.

21
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:58,000
70% of the students
love chocolate.

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,370
So I would be in
that category.

23
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:03,470
And 40% fall into
both categories.

24
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:06,550
And our job is to determine
the probability that a

25
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:10,060
randomly selected student is
neither a genius nor a

26
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:11,400
chocolate lover.

27
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,330
So first I just want to write
down the information that

28
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:16,800
we're given in the problem
statement.

29
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:21,580
So if you let G denote the event
that a randomly selected

30
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:25,990
student is a genius then the
problem statement tells us

31
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:30,360
that the probability of
G is equal to 0.6.

32
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,890
Similarly, if we let C denote
the event that a randomly

33
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:37,390
selected student is a chocolate
lover, then we have

34
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:42,240
that the probability of
C is equal to 0.7.

35
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,340
Lastly, we are told that the
probability a randomly

36
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:49,610
selected student falls into
both categories is 0.4.

37
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:52,590
And the way we can express
that using the notation

38
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:58,320
already on the board is
probability of G intersect C

39
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,610
is equal to 0.4.

40
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:05,770
OK, now one way of approaching
this problem is to essentially

41
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:10,120
use this information and sort of
massage it using properties

42
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:13,310
of probability laws to
get to our answer.

43
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:16,710
Instead, I'm going to take a
different approach, which I

44
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:18,120
think will be helpful.

45
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,860
So namely, we're going
to use something

46
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,250
called a Venn diagram.

47
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:28,320
Now a Venn diagram is just a
tool that's really useful for

48
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:31,750
telling you how different sets
relate to each other and how

49
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,310
their corresponding
probabilities

50
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:34,770
relate to each other.

51
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:38,660
So the way you usually draw this
is you draw a rectangle,

52
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:41,420
which denotes your sample space,
which of course, we

53
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:42,620
call omega.

54
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:45,860
And then you draw two
intersecting circles.

55
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:51,070
So one to represent our geniuses
and one to represent

56
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:52,430
our chocolate lovers.

57
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:55,970
And the reason why I drew them
intersecting is because we

58
00:02:55,970 --> 00:03:00,730
know that there are 40% of the
students in our class are both

59
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:02,540
geniuses and chocolate lovers.

60
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:07,610
OK, and the way you sort of
interpret this diagram is the

61
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:12,440
space outside these two circles
correspond to students

62
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:16,000
who are neither geniuses
nor chocolate lovers.

63
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,050
And so just keep in mind that
the probability corresponding

64
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:22,330
to these students on the
outside, that's actually what

65
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:24,200
we're looking for.

66
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:28,710
Similarly, students in this
little shape, this tear drop

67
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:31,150
in the middle, those would
correspond to geniuses and

68
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:32,400
chocolate lovers.

69
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,820
You probably get the idea.

70
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:36,620
So this is our Venn diagram.

71
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:40,560
Now I'm going to give you guys
a second trick if you will.

72
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,030
And that is to work
with partitions.

73
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:47,240
So I believe you've seen
partitions in lecture by now.

74
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:50,730
And a partition is essentially a
way of cutting up the sample

75
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,480
space into pieces.

76
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,500
But you need two properties
to be true.

77
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,810
So the pieces that you cut up
your sample space into, they

78
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:02,260
need to be disjoint, so
they can't overlap.

79
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:06,610
So for instance, G and C are
not disjoint because they

80
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:10,000
overlap in this tear
drop region.

81
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,750
Now the second thing that a
partition has to satisfy is

82
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:16,300
that if you put all the pieces
together, they have to

83
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,670
comprise the entire
sample space.

84
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:22,940
So I'm just going to put these
labels down on my graph.

85
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:28,700
X, Y, Z, and W. So X is
everything outside the two

86
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:31,300
circles but inside
the rectangle.

87
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:35,180
And just note, again, that what
we're actually trying to

88
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:38,380
solve in this problem is the
probability of X, the

89
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:40,890
probability that you're neither
genius, because you're

90
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:43,740
not in this circle, and you're
not a chocolate lover, because

91
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:46,040
you're not in this circle.

92
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:50,330
So Y I'm using to refer
to this sort of

93
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:52,270
crescent moon shape.

94
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:55,680
Z, I'm using to refer
to this tear drop.

95
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,640
And W, I'm using to refer
to this shape.

96
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:03,590
So, hopefully, you agree that
X, Y, Z, and W form a

97
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:05,530
partition because they
don't overlap.

98
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:06,890
So they are disjoint.

99
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:09,160
And together they form omega.

100
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,690
So now we're ready to
do some computation.

101
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:15,730
The first step is to sort of
get the information we have

102
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:19,660
written down here in terms
of these new labels.

103
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:27,110
So hopefully, you guys buy that
G is just the union of Y

104
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:32,740
and Z. And because Y and Z are
disjoint, we get that the

105
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:35,620
probability of the union is the
sum of the probabilities.

106
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:39,620
And, of course, we have from
before that this is 0.6.

107
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:43,220
Similarly, we have that the
probability of C is equal to

108
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:47,920
the probability of Z union W.
And, again, using the fact

109
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,660
that these two guys are
disjoint, you get this

110
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:51,850
expression.

111
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:54,950
And that is equal to 0.7.

112
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:58,790
OK, and the last piece of
information, G intersects C

113
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:02,810
corresponds to Z, or our tear
drop, and so we have that the

114
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:06,450
probability of Z is
equal to 0.4.

115
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:09,830
And now, if you notice,
probability of Z shows up in

116
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:11,520
these two equations.

117
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,760
So we can just plug it in.

118
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,820
So plug in 0.4 into
this equation.

119
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:20,830
We get P of Y plus 0.4 is 0.6.

120
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:23,050
So that implies that
P of Y is 0.2.

121
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:25,110
That's just algebra.

122
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:27,090
And similarly we have point.

123
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:30,800
0.4 plus P of W is
equal to 0.7.

124
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,770
So that implies that
P of W is 0.3.

125
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:36,630
Again, that's just algebra.

126
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:39,880
So now we're doing really well
because we have a lot of

127
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,840
information.

128
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,930
We know the probability of Y,
the probability of Z, the

129
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:48,300
probability of W. But remember
we're going for, we're trying

130
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:52,260
to find the probability of X. So
the way we finally put all

131
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:56,250
this information together to
solve for X is we use the

132
00:06:56,250 --> 00:07:00,890
axiom that tells us that 1 is
equal to the probability of

133
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:02,860
the sample space.

134
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:05,330
And then, again, we're going
to use sort of this really

135
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:10,090
helpful fact that X, Y, Z, and W
form a partition of omega to

136
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:14,310
go ahead and write this as
probability of X plus

137
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:17,800
probability of Y plus
probability,

138
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,540
oops, I made a mistake.

139
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,680
Hopefully, you guys
caught that.

140
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,522
It's really, oh, no.

141
00:07:23,522 --> 00:07:24,235
I'm right.

142
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:25,790
Never mind.

143
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:28,030
Probability of X plus
probability of Y plus

144
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:32,040
probability of Z plus
probability of W. And now we

145
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,860
can go ahead and plug-in the
values that we solved for

146
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,140
previously.

147
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:43,480
So we get probability of X plus
0.2 plus 0.4 plus 0.3.

148
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,600
These guys sum to 0.9.

149
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:49,010
So, again, just simple
arithmetic, we get that the

150
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:52,720
probability of X is
equal to 0.1.

151
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:57,100
So we're done because we've
successfully found that the

152
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:00,060
probability that a randomly
selected student is neither a

153
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:03,520
genius nor a chocolate
lover is 0.1.

154
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,600
So this was a fairly
straightforward problem.

155
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,180
But there are some important
takeaways.

156
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:11,090
The first one is that
Venn diagrams are

157
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,470
a really nice tool.

158
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:16,450
Whenever the problem is asking
you how different sets relate

159
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:18,890
to each other or how different
probabilities relate to each

160
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:21,870
other, you should probably draw
Venn diagram because it

161
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:23,530
will help you.

162
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:28,870
And the second takeaway is that
it's frequently useful to

163
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:33,760
divide your sample space into
a partition mainly because

164
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,320
sort of the pieces
that compose a

165
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,929
partition are disjoint.

166
00:08:37,929 --> 00:08:40,599
So we will be back soon to
solve more problems.

167
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:42,366
