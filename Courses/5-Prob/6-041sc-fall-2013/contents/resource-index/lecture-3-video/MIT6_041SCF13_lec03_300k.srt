00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:23,750

10
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:26,970
PROFESSOR: Let us start.

11
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:30,080
So as always, we're to have
a quick review of what we

12
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,240
discussed last time.

13
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,240
And then today we're going
to introduce just one new

14
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:38,120
concept, the notion of
independence of two events.

15
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:41,030
And we will play with
that concept.

16
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:43,110
So what did we talk
about last time?

17
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:46,410
The idea is that we have an
experiment, and the experiment

18
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:48,800
has a sample space omega.

19
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,300
And then somebody comes and
tells us you know the outcome

20
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:56,840
of the experiments happens to
lie inside this particular

21
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,470
event B. Given this information,
it kind of

22
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:03,070
changes what we know about
the situation.

23
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:05,510
It tells us that the outcome
is going to be somewhere

24
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:06,630
inside here.

25
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:09,800
So this is essentially
our new sample space.

26
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,130
And now we need to we reassign
probabilities to the various

27
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:16,550
possible outcomes, because, for
example, these outcomes,

28
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:20,340
even if they had positive
probability beforehand, now

29
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,890
that we're told that B occurred,
those outcomes out

30
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:25,220
there are going to have
zero probability.

31
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:27,670
So we need to revise
our probabilities.

32
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:29,740
The new probabilities are
called conditional

33
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:33,390
probabilities, and they're
defined this way.

34
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:37,000
The conditional probability that
A occurs given that we're

35
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,670
told that B occurred is
calculated by this formula,

36
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:42,880
which tells us the following--

37
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,750
out of the total probability
that was initially assigned to

38
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:49,760
the event B, what fraction of
that probability is assigned

39
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:54,310
to outcomes that also
make A to happen?

40
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:58,650
So out of the total probability
assigned to B, we

41
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:03,080
see what fraction of that total
probability is assigned

42
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:06,650
to those elements here that
will also make A happen.

43
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:09,360
Conditional probabilities are
left undefined if the

44
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,860
denominator here is zero.

45
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:16,030
An easy consequence of the
definition is if we bring that

46
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:18,670
term to the other side, then we
can find the probability of

47
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:22,040
two things happening by taking
the probability that the first

48
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:25,170
thing happens, and then, given
that the first thing happened,

49
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:28,230
the conditional probability that
the second one happens.

50
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:31,680
Then we saw last time that we
can divide and conquer in

51
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,010
calculating probabilities of
mildly complicated events by

52
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:39,070
breaking it down into
different scenarios.

53
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:41,350
So event B can happen
in two ways.

54
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:44,810
It can happen either together
with A, which is this

55
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:48,700
probability, or it can happen
together with A complement,

56
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:49,880
which is this probability.

57
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:53,100
So basically what we're saying
that the total probability of

58
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:57,960
B is the probability of this,
which is A intersection B,

59
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:02,620
plus the probability of that,
which is A complement

60
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:07,530
intersection B.

61
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:11,355
So these two facts here,
multiplication rule and the

62
00:03:11,355 --> 00:03:14,760
total probability theorem, are
basic tools that one uses to

63
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,990
break down probability
calculations

64
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:18,930
into a simpler parts.

65
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:21,600
So we find probabilities of
two things happening by

66
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,300
looking at each one at a time.

67
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:27,830
And this is what we do to break
up a situation with two

68
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:29,760
different possible scenarios.

69
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,110
Then we also have
the Bayes rule,

70
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:33,600
which does the following.

71
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,640
Given a model that has
conditional probabilities of

72
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,970
this kind, the Bayes rule
allows us to calculate

73
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:41,570
conditional probabilities in
which the events appear in

74
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:43,020
different order.

75
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:45,740
You can think of these
probabilities as describing a

76
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:49,270
causal model of a certain
situation, whereas these are

77
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:52,670
the probabilities that you get
after you do some inference

78
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:55,480
based on the information that
you have available.

79
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:59,200
Now the Bayes rule, we derived
it, and it's a trivial

80
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,040
half-line calculation.

81
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,670
But it underlies lots
and lots of useful

82
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:05,290
things in the real world.

83
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:07,650
We had the radar example
last time.

84
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:10,410
You can think of more
complicated situations in

85
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:14,570
which there's a bunch or lots of
different hypotheses about

86
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:15,920
the environment.

87
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,899
Given any particular setting in
the environment, you have a

88
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:21,140
measuring device that
can produce

89
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:23,670
many different outcomes.

90
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:29,210
And you observe the final
outcome out of your measuring

91
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:31,820
device, and you're trying
to guess which

92
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:34,210
particular branch occurred.

93
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:36,640
That is, you're trying to guess
the state of the world

94
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,500
based on a particular
measurement.

95
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,770
That's what inference
is all about.

96
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:44,450
So real world problems only
differ from the simple example

97
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:48,610
that we saw last time in that
this kind of tree is a little

98
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:50,040
more complicated.

99
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,150
You might have infinitely
many possible

100
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:54,450
outcomes here and so on.

101
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:57,960
So setting up the model may be
more elaborate, but the basic

102
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:01,170
calculation that's done based
on the Bayes rule is

103
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:04,430
essentially the same as
the one that we saw.

104
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:07,190
Now something that we discuss
is that sometimes we use

105
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:11,050
conditional probabilities to
describe models, and let's do

106
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:14,030
this by looking at a
model where we toss

107
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:16,150
a coin three times.

108
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:19,090
And how do we use conditional
probabilities to

109
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:20,630
describe the situation?

110
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:22,950
So we have one experiment.

111
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:26,590
But that one experiment consists
of three consecutive

112
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:27,880
coin tosses.

113
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:32,380
So the possible outcomes, our
sample space, consists of

114
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:37,070
strings of length 3 that tell
us whether we had heads,

115
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,200
tails, and in what sequence.

116
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:43,110
So three heads in a row is
one particular outcome.

117
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:46,460
So what is the meaning
of those labels in

118
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:48,030
front of the branches?

119
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:51,850
So this P here, of course,
stands for the probability

120
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:55,640
that the first toss
resulted in heads.

121
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:59,270
And let me use this notation
to denote that

122
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:01,170
the first was heads.

123
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:04,570
I put an H in toss one.

124
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:08,350
How about the meaning of
this probability here?

125
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:10,570
Well the meaning of this
probability is

126
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:11,670
a conditional one.

127
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:14,170
It's the conditional probability
that the second

128
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:18,340
toss resulted in heads,
given that the first

129
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:21,440
one resulted in heads.

130
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:26,830
And similarly this label here
corresponds to the probability

131
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:31,550
that the third toss resulted in
heads, given that the first

132
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:35,010
one and the second one
resulted in heads.

133
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:39,610
So in this particular model that
I wrote down here, those

134
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:44,740
probabilities, P, of obtaining
heads remain the same no

135
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:47,570
matter what happened in
the previous toss.

136
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:52,020
For example, even if the first
toss was tails, we still have

137
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:56,920
the same probability, P, that
the second one is heads, given

138
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,100
that the first one was tails.

139
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,820
So we're assuming that no matter
what happened in the

140
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:05,550
first toss, the second toss will
still have a conditional

141
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:08,960
probability equal to P. So that
conditional probability

142
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,800
does not depend on what happened
in the first toss.

143
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,040
And we will see that this is a
very special situation, and

144
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:19,240
that's really the concept of
independence that we are going

145
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,850
to introduce shortly.

146
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:25,540
But before we get to
independence, let's practice

147
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:29,060
once more the three skills that
we covered last time in

148
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,490
this example.

149
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:33,470
So first skill was
multiplication rule.

150
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:35,660
How do you find the
probability of

151
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:38,000
several things happening?

152
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,390
That is the probability that
we have tails followed by

153
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:44,140
heads followed by tails.

154
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:50,350
So here we're talking about this
particular outcome here,

155
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:53,130
tails followed by heads
followed by tails.

156
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:57,070
And the way we calculate such
a probability is by

157
00:07:57,070 --> 00:08:01,480
multiplying conditional
probabilities along the path

158
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,560
that takes us to this outcome.

159
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,160
And so these conditional
probabilities

160
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,220
are recorded here.

161
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:11,840
So it's going to be (1 minus P)
times P times (1 minus P).

162
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,480
So this is the multiplication
rule.

163
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:17,990
Second question is how do we
find the probability of a

164
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:20,510
mildly complicated event?

165
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:23,520
So the event of interest here
that I wrote down is the

166
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,850
probability that in the
three tosses, we had a

167
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:28,650
total of one head.

168
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:30,470
Exactly one head.

169
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:33,450
This is an event that can
happen in multiple ways.

170
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:35,940
It happens here.

171
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:38,200
It happens here.

172
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,380
And it also happens here.

173
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:44,480
So we want to find the total
probability of the event

174
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,290
consisting of these
three outcomes.

175
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:47,370
What do we do?

176
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:51,100
We just add the probabilities
of each individual outcome.

177
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:53,850
How do we find the probability
of an individual outcome?

178
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:56,250
Well, that's what we just did.

179
00:08:56,250 --> 00:09:00,300
Now notice that this outcome
has probability P times (1

180
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,550
minus P) squared.

181
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:04,260

182
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:07,000
That one should not be there.

183
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,984
So where is it?

184
00:09:08,984 --> 00:09:09,750
Ah.

185
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,000
It's this one.

186
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,830

187
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:18,610
OK, so the probability of this
outcome is (1 minus P times P)

188
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:20,970
times (1 minus P), the
same probability.

189
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:25,470
And finally, this one is again
(1 minus P) squared times P.

190
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:29,240
So this event of one head can
happen in three ways.

191
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:32,270
And each one of those three ways
has the same probability

192
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:33,380
of occurring.

193
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:36,440
And this is the answer.

194
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:40,110
And finally, the last thing that
we learned how to do is

195
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:41,980
to use the Bayes rule to

196
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:44,230
calculate and make an inference.

197
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:47,045
So somebody tells you that there
was exactly one head in

198
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:49,350
your three tosses.

199
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:52,610
What is the probability
that the first

200
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:55,110
toss resulted in heads?

201
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:59,980
OK, I guess you can guess the
answer here if I tell you that

202
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:01,710
there were three tosses.

203
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:03,590
One of them was heads.

204
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:05,670
Where was that head
in the first, the

205
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:07,300
second, or the third?

206
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:10,410
Well, by symmetry, they should
all be equally likely.

207
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:13,770
So there should be probably
just 1/3 that that head

208
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:16,070
occurred in the first toss.

209
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:19,230
Let's check our intuition
using the definitions.

210
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:21,280
So the definition of conditional
probability tells

211
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:26,030
us the conditional probability
is the probability of both

212
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:27,310
things happening.

213
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:33,890
First toss is heads, and we have
exactly one head divided

214
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:36,430
by the probability
of one head.

215
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:40,720

216
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,860
What is the probability that the
first toss is heads, and

217
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:47,340
we have exactly one head?

218
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:51,810
This is the same as the event
heads, tails, tails.

219
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:54,280
If I tell you that the first is
heads, and there's only one

220
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:57,030
head, it means that the
others are tails.

221
00:10:57,030 --> 00:11:03,080
So this is the probability of
heads, tails, tails divided by

222
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:06,080
the probability of one head.

223
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,660
And we know all of these
quantities probability of

224
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:12,080
heads, tails, tails is P times
(1 minus P) squared.

225
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,806
Probability of one
head is 3 times P

226
00:11:14,806 --> 00:11:17,680
times (1 minus P) squared.

227
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:22,820
So the final answer is 1/3,
which is what you should have

228
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:27,280
a guessed on intuitive
grounds.

229
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:27,740
Very good.

230
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:31,110
So we got our practice on
the material that we

231
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:33,040
did cover last time.

232
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:33,700
Again, think.

233
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:38,050
There's basically three basic
skills that we are practicing

234
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:40,210
and exercising here.

235
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:43,870
In the problems, quizzes, and in
the real life, you may have

236
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:47,560
to apply those three skills in
somewhat more complicated

237
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,590
settings, but in the
end that's what it

238
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:51,860
boils down to usually.

239
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:55,240
Now let's focus on this special
feature of this

240
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:59,610
particular model that I
discussed a little earlier.

241
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:03,010
Think of the event heads
in the second toss.

242
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:05,690

243
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:09,750
Initially, the probability of
heads in the second toss, you

244
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:12,460
know, that it's P, the
probability of

245
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,290
success of your coin.

246
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:19,100
If I tell you that the first
toss resulted in heads, what's

247
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,240
the probability that the
second toss is heads?

248
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,870
It's again P. If I tell you that
the first toss was tails,

249
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:27,510
what's the probability that
the second toss is heads?

250
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:33,290
It's again P. So whether I tell
you the result of the

251
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:37,280
first toss, or I don't tell
you, it doesn't make any

252
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,490
difference to you.

253
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:40,690
You would always say the
probability of heads in the

254
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:44,970
second toss is going to P, no
matter what happened in the

255
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:46,400
first toss.

256
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:49,550
This is a special situation to
which we're going to give a

257
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:53,540
name, and we're going to call
that property independence.

258
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:58,520
Basically independence between
two things stands for the fact

259
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:02,690
that the first thing, whether
it occurred or not, doesn't

260
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:05,630
give you any information, does
not cause you to change your

261
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:08,980
beliefs about the
second event.

262
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:11,600
This is the intuition.

263
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:16,130
Let's try to translate this
into mathematics.

264
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:19,510
We have two events, and we're
going to say that they're

265
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:26,010
independent if your initial
beliefs about B are not going

266
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:30,140
to change if I tell you
that A occurred.

267
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:34,700
So you believe something
how likely B is.

268
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:37,640
Then somebody comes and tells
you, you know, A has happened.

269
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,790
Are you going to change
your beliefs?

270
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:42,200
No, I'm not going
to change them.

271
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,020
Whenever you are in such a
situation, then you say that

272
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:47,040
the two events are
independent.

273
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:51,470
Intuitively, the fact that A
occurred does not convey any

274
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:55,720
information to you about the
likelihood of event B. The

275
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,480
information that A provides
is not so

276
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,780
useful, is not relevant.

277
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:03,010
A has to do with
something else.

278
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:06,250
It's not useful for your
guessing whether B is going to

279
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:07,780
occur or not.

280
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:13,650
So we can take this as a first
attempt into a definition of

281
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:15,870
independence.

282
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:23,130
Now remember that we have this
property, the probability of

283
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:25,690
two things happening is the
probability of the first times

284
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:27,920
the conditional probability
of the second.

285
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,390
If we have independence, this
conditional probability is the

286
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:33,840
same as the unconditional
probability.

287
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:38,040
So if we have independence
according to that definition,

288
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:41,190
we get this property that you
can find the probability of

289
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:44,440
two things happening by just
multiplying their individual

290
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,640
probabilities.

291
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:48,070
Probability of heads in
the first toss is 1/2.

292
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:50,900
Probability of heads in the
second toss is 1/2.

293
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:54,200
Probability of heads
heads is 1/4.

294
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,590
That's what happens if your two
tosses are independent of

295
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:58,730
each other.

296
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:03,110
So this property here is
a consequence of this

297
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:08,470
definition, but it's actually
nicer, better, simpler,

298
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:12,880
cleaner, more beautiful to take
this as our definition

299
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,380
instead of that one.

300
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:17,180
Are the two definitions
equivalent?

301
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:21,040
Well, they're are almost the
same, except for one thing.

302
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,250
Conditional probabilities are
only defined if you condition

303
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,900
on an event that has positive
probability.

304
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:31,090
So this definition would be
limited to cases where event A

305
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:34,080
has positive probability,
whereas this definition is

306
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:38,140
something that you can
write down always.

307
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:43,280
We will say that two events are
independent if and only if

308
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:46,940
their probability of happening
simultaneously is equal to the

309
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:50,470
product of their two individual
probabilities.

310
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:54,690
And in particular, we can have
events of zero probability.

311
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:56,220
There's nothing wrong
with that.

312
00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:01,450
If A has 0 probability, then A
intersection B will also have

313
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:04,990
zero probability, because it's
an even smaller event.

314
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:09,200
And so we're going to get
zero is equal to zero.

315
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:13,920
A corollary of what I just said,
if an event A has zero

316
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,700
probability, it's actually
independent of any other event

317
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:20,220
in our model, because
we're going to get

318
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:21,810
zero is equal to zero.

319
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:24,140
And the definition is going
to be satisfied.

320
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:27,560
This is a little bit harder to
reconcile with the intuition

321
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:32,800
we have about independence, but
then again, it's part of

322
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,610
the mathematical definition.

323
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:40,450
So what I want you to retain
is this notion that the

324
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:46,300
independence is something that
you can check formally using

325
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:50,420
this definition, but also you
can check intuitively by if,

326
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:54,280
in some cases, you can reason
that whatever happens and

327
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:58,310
determines whether A is going
to occur or not, has nothing

328
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:01,850
absolutely to do with whatever
happens and determines whether

329
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:04,369
B is going to occur or not.

330
00:17:04,369 --> 00:17:08,440
So if I'm doing a science
experiment in this room, and

331
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:12,569
it gets hit by some noise that's
causes randomness.

332
00:17:12,569 --> 00:17:16,040
And then five years later,
somebody somewhere else does

333
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:19,069
the same science experiment
somewhere else, it gets hit by

334
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:23,230
other noise, you would usually
say that these experiments are

335
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:23,940
independent.

336
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:30,230
So what events happen in one
experiment are not going to

337
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:33,290
change your beliefs about what
might be happening in the

338
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:36,610
other, because the sources of
noise in these two experiments

339
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:38,350
are completely unrelated.

340
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,110
They have nothing to
do with each other.

341
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:43,470
So if I flip a coin here today,
and I flip a coin in my

342
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:47,890
office tomorrow, one shouldn't
affect the other.

343
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:52,690
So the events that I get from
these should be independent.

344
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:55,700
So that's usually how
independence arises.

345
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,580
By having distinct physical

346
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:59,940
phenomena that do not interact.

347
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:03,690
Sometimes you also get
independence even though there

348
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:06,590
is a physical interaction, but
you just happen to have a

349
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:08,930
numerical accident.

350
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:13,340
A and B might be physically
related very tightly, but a

351
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:16,820
numerical accident happens and
you get equality here, that's

352
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:20,070
another case where we
do get independence.

353
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:24,350
Now suppose that we have
two events that are

354
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:27,380
laid out like this.

355
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:30,240
Are these two events
independent or not?

356
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:34,570

357
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:36,620
The picture kind of tells
you that one is

358
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:38,140
separate from the other.

359
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:41,170
But separate has nothing
to do with independent.

360
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:45,340
In fact, these two events are as
dependent as Siamese twins.

361
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:46,480
Why is that?

362
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:51,560
If I tell you that A occurred,
then you are certain that B

363
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,060
did not occur.

364
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:57,780
So information about the
occurrence of A definitely

365
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:01,090
affects your beliefs about the
possible occurrence or

366
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:05,490
non-occurrence of B. When the
picture is like that, knowing

367
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:09,480
that A occurred will change
drastically my beliefs about

368
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:13,030
B, because now I suddenly
become certain

369
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:14,870
that B did not occur.

370
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:18,260
So a picture like this is a
case actually of extreme

371
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,360
dependence.

372
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,440
So don't confuse independence
with disjointness.

373
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,406
They're very different
types of properties.

374
00:19:26,406 --> 00:19:27,080
AUDIENCE: Question.

375
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:27,520
PROFESSOR: Yes?

376
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,400
AUDIENCE: So I understand
the explanation, but the

377
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,954
probability of A intersect B
[INAUDIBLE] to zero, because

378
00:19:31,954 --> 00:19:32,910
they're disjoint.

379
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:33,388
PROFESSOR: Yes.

380
00:19:33,388 --> 00:19:35,539
AUDIENCE: But then the product
of probability A and

381
00:19:35,539 --> 00:19:37,690
probability B, one of them
is going to be 1.

382
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:39,602
[INAUDIBLE]

383
00:19:39,602 --> 00:19:42,690
PROFESSOR: No, suppose that
the probabilities are 1/3,

384
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:46,610
1/4, and the rest
is out there.

385
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:48,560
You check the definition
of independence.

386
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:52,440
Probability of A intersection
B is zero.

387
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:58,520
Probability of A times the
probability of B is 1/12.

388
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,630
The two are not equal.

389
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:02,710
Therefore we do not
have independence.

390
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:03,199
AUDIENCE: Right.

391
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:05,644
So what's wrong with the
intuition of the probability

392
00:20:05,644 --> 00:20:09,556
of A being 1, and the
other one being 0?

393
00:20:09,556 --> 00:20:12,490
[INAUDIBLE].

394
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:12,610
PROFESSOR: No.

395
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:19,340
The probability of A given
B is equal to 0.

396
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:23,870
Probability of A is
equal to 1/3.

397
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:26,650
So again, these two
are different.

398
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:30,210
So we had some initial beliefs
about A, but as soon as we are

399
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:34,440
told that B occurred, our
beliefs about A changed.

400
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:37,770
And so since our beliefs
changed, that means that B

401
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:40,666
conveys information about A.

402
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:42,931
AUDIENCE: So can you not draw
independent [INAUDIBLE] on a

403
00:20:42,931 --> 00:20:43,390
Venn diagram?

404
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:44,430
PROFESSOR: I can't hear you.

405
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:45,352
AUDIENCE: Can you draw

406
00:20:45,352 --> 00:20:46,735
independence on a Venn diagram?

407
00:20:46,735 --> 00:20:51,320
PROFESSOR: No, the Venn diagram
is never enough to

408
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,400
decide independence.

409
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,350
So the typical picture in which
you're going to have

410
00:20:56,350 --> 00:21:00,120
independence would be one event
this way, and another

411
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,760
event this way.

412
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,800
You need to take the probability
of this times the

413
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:07,795
probability of that, and check
that, numerically, it's equal

414
00:21:07,795 --> 00:21:11,350
to the probability of
this intersection.

415
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:14,330
So it's more than
a Venn diagram.

416
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:16,138
Numbers need to come
out right.

417
00:21:16,138 --> 00:21:19,730

418
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:23,570
Now we did say some time ago
that conditional probabilities

419
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:27,680
are just like ordinary
probabilities, and whatever we

420
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:31,870
do in probability theory
can also be done

421
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:34,350
in conditional universes.

422
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:37,680
Talking about conditional
probabilities.

423
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:42,870
So since we have a notion of
independence, then there

424
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:47,470
should be also a notion of
conditional independence.

425
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:55,070
So independence was defined
by the probability that A

426
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:59,070
intersection B is equal to the
probability of A times the

427
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:01,920
probability of B.

428
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:05,670
What would be a reasonable
definition of conditional

429
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:06,840
independence?

430
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,355
Conditional independence would
mean that this same property

431
00:22:09,355 --> 00:22:13,210
could be true, but in a
conditional universe where we

432
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:15,660
are told that the certain
event happens.

433
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:19,060
So if we're told that the event
C has happened, then

434
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:22,240
were transported in a
conditional universe where the

435
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,460
only thing that matters are
conditional probabilities.

436
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:31,320
And this is just the same plain,
previous definition of

437
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:35,190
independence, but applied in
a conditional universe.

438
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:40,020
So this is the definition of
conditional independence.

439
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:43,390

440
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:46,940
So it's independence, but with
reference to the conditional

441
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:48,830
probabilities.

442
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:51,830
And intuitively it has, again,
the same meaning, that in the

443
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:56,410
conditional world, if I tell you
that A occurred, then that

444
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:58,940
doesn't change your
beliefs about B.

445
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:01,100
So suppose you had a
picture like this.

446
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:06,880
And somebody told you that
events A and B are independent

447
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,630
unconditionally.

448
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:14,320
Then somebody comes and tells
you that event C actually has

449
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:18,150
occurred, so we now live
in this new universe.

450
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:22,450
In this new universe, is the
independence of A and B going

451
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:25,180
to be preserved or not?

452
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:29,300
Are A and B independent
in this new universe?

453
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:34,780
The answer is no, because in the
new universe, whatever is

454
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,790
left of event A is this piece.

455
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:39,630
Whatever is left of event
B is this piece.

456
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:42,310
And these two pieces
are disjoint.

457
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:45,490
So we are back in a situation
of this kind.

458
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:46,450
So in the conditional

459
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:49,620
universe, A and B are disjoint.

460
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:53,380
And therefore, generically,
they're not going to be

461
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:54,730
independent.

462
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:58,030
What's the moral of
this example?

463
00:23:58,030 --> 00:24:01,870
Having independence in the
original model does not imply

464
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:05,930
independence in a conditional
model.

465
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:08,490
The opposite is also possible.

466
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:12,160
And let's illustrate
by another example.

467
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:17,960
So I have two coins, and both
of them are badly biased.

468
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:21,680
One coin is much biased
in favor of heads.

469
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:25,320
The other coin is much biased
in favor of tails.

470
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:28,050
So the probabilities
being 90%.

471
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:33,050
Let's consider independent flips
of coin A. This is the

472
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:34,980
relevant model.

473
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:39,600
This is a model of two
independent flips

474
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,240
of the first coin.

475
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,850
There's going to be two flips,
and each one has probability

476
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:46,080
0.9 of being heads.

477
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,330
So that's a model that describes
coin A. You can

478
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:52,540
think of this as a conditional
model which is a model of the

479
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:55,940
coin flips conditioned on the
fact that they have chosen

480
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:57,460
coin A.

481
00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:01,460
Alternatively we could be
dealing with coin B In a

482
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:05,260
conditional world where we
chose coin B and flip it

483
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:08,130
twice, this is the
relevant model.

484
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:10,660
The probability of two heads,
for example, is the

485
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:13,280
probability of heads the first
time, heads the second time,

486
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:16,070
and each one is 0.1.

487
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:19,960
Now I'm building this into a
bigger experiment in which I

488
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:25,160
first start by choosing one of
the two coins at random.

489
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,620
So I have these two coins.

490
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:28,610
I blindly pick one of them.

491
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:32,610
And then I start
flipping them.

492
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:36,620
So the question now is, are the
coin flips, or the coin

493
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:39,730
tosses, are they independent
of each other?

494
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:46,370
If we just stay inside this
sub-model here, are the coin

495
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:47,620
flips independent?

496
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:52,240

497
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:56,540
They are independent, because
the probability of heads in

498
00:25:56,540 --> 00:26:01,780
the second toss is the same,
0.9, no matter what happened

499
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:03,550
in the first toss.

500
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:06,550
So the conditional probabilities
of what happens

501
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:10,050
in the second toss are not
affected by the outcome of the

502
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:11,180
first toss.

503
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:14,620
So the second toss and the first
toss are independent.

504
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:17,800
So here we're just dealing
with plain,

505
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,990
independent coin flips.

506
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:24,940
Similarity the coin flips within
this sub-model are also

507
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:26,190
independent.

508
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:28,840

509
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:33,410
Now the question is, if we look
at the big model as just

510
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:38,955
one probability model, instead
of looking at the conditional

511
00:26:38,955 --> 00:26:44,530
sub-models, are the coin flips
independent of each other?

512
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:49,590
Does the outcome of a few coin
flips give you information

513
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:53,610
about subsequent coin flips?

514
00:26:53,610 --> 00:27:02,570
Well if I observe ten
heads in a row--

515
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:05,960
So instead of two coin flips,
now let's think of doing more

516
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:10,070
of them so that the tree
gets expanded.

517
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:13,800
So let's start with this.

518
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,020
I don't know which coin it is.

519
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:18,970
What's the probability that
the 11th coin toss

520
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,220
is going to be heads?

521
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:25,570

522
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:29,370
There's complete symmetry here,
so the answer could not

523
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:32,330
be anything other than 1/2.

524
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:36,950
So let's justify it,
why is it 1/2?

525
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:40,560
Well, the probability that the
11th toss is heads, how can

526
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,380
that outcome happen?

527
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:43,840
It can happen in two ways.

528
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:50,480
You can choose coin A, which
happens with probability 1/2.

529
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:54,370
And having chosen coin A,
there's probability 0.9 that

530
00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:58,500
it results in that you get
heads in the 11th toss.

531
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:03,540
Or you can choose coin B. And
if it's coin B when you flip

532
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:06,710
it, there's probably 0.1
that you have heads.

533
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:08,860
So the final answer is 1/2.

534
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:11,370

535
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:14,820
So each one of the coins is
biased, but they're biased in

536
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:16,190
different ways.

537
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:20,340
If I don't know which coin it
is, their two biases kind of

538
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:23,740
cancel out, and the probability
of obtaining heads

539
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:27,880
is just in the middle,
then it's 1/2.

540
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:31,720
Now if someone tells you that
the first ten tosses were

541
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:34,940
heads, is that going to
change your beliefs

542
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:37,300
about the 11th toss?

543
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:41,820
Here's how a reasonable person
would think about it.

544
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:49,480
If it's coin B the probability
of obtaining 10 heads in a row

545
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,510
is negligible.

546
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:55,270
It's going to be 0.1
to the 10th.

547
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:59,110
If it's coin A. The probability
of 10 heads in a

548
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:01,380
row is a more reasonable
number.

549
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:03,850
It's 0.9 to the 10th.

550
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:10,320
So this event is a lot more
likely to occur with coin A,

551
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,910
rather than coin B.

552
00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:18,820
The plausible explanation of
having seen ten heads in a row

553
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:25,730
is that I actually chose coin A.
When you see ten heads in a

554
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:29,690
row, you are pretty certain that
it's coin A that we're

555
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:30,940
dealing with.

556
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:33,800
And once you're pretty certain
that it's coin A that we're

557
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:36,350
dealing with, what's the
probability that the

558
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:38,246
next toss is heads?

559
00:29:38,246 --> 00:29:40,960
It's going to be 0.9.

560
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:45,270
So essentially here I'm doing
an inference calculation.

561
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:48,990
Given this information, I'm
making an inference about

562
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:50,700
which coin I'm dealing with.

563
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:53,540

564
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:57,240
I become pretty certain that
it's coin A, and given that

565
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:00,640
it's coin A, this probability
is going to be 0.9.

566
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,070
And I'm putting an approximate
sign here, because the

567
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:06,220
inference that I did
is approximate.

568
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:09,850
I'm pretty certain it's coin A.
I'm not 100% certain that

569
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:11,200
it's coin A.

570
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:15,430
But in any case what happens
here is that the unconditional

571
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:19,440
probability is different from
the conditional probability.

572
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:23,710
This information here makes
me change my beliefs

573
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:25,590
about the 11th toss.

574
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:30,560
And this means that the 11th
toss is dependent on the

575
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,530
previous tosses.

576
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:35,590
So the coin tosses have
now become dependent.

577
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:38,790
What is the physical link that
causes this dependence?

578
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:42,710
Well, the physical link is
the choice of the coin.

579
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:46,580
By choosing a particular coin,
I'm introducing a pattern in

580
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:48,200
the future coin tosses.

581
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:52,740
And that pattern is what
causes dependence.

582
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:55,670
OK, so I've been playing a
little bit too loose with the

583
00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:59,810
language here, because we
defined the concept of

584
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:01,810
independence of two events.

585
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:06,180
But here I have been referring
to independent coin tosses,

586
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:08,380
where I'm thinking about
many coin tosses,

587
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:11,200
like 10 or 11 of them.

588
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:15,160
So to be proper, I should have
defined for you also the

589
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:18,710
notion of independence of
multiple events, not just two.

590
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:21,970
We don't want to just say coin
toss one is independent from

591
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:23,170
coin toss two.

592
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:26,250
We want to be able to say
something like, these 10 then

593
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:29,690
coin tosses are all independent
of each other.

594
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:33,800
Intuitively what that means
should be the same thing--

595
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:37,450
that information about some of
the coin tosses doesn't change

596
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:40,220
your beliefs about the remaining
coin tosses.

597
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:43,580
How do we translate that into
a mathematical definition?

598
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:48,600
Well, an ugly attempt
would be to impose

599
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:51,800
requirements such as this.

600
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:56,780
Think of A1 being the event that
the first flip was heads.

601
00:31:56,780 --> 00:32:00,980
A2 is the event of that the
second flip was heads.

602
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:04,320
A3, the third flip, was
heads, and so on.

603
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:08,310
Here is an event whose
occurrence is not determined

604
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:10,860
by the first three coin flips.

605
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:13,400
And here's an event whose
occurrence or not is

606
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:16,680
determined by the fifth
and sixth coin flip.

607
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:19,080
If we think physically that
all those coin flips have

608
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:22,220
nothing to do with each other,
information about the fifth

609
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:26,420
and sixth coin flip are not
going to change what we expect

610
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:27,960
from the first three.

611
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:30,780
So the probability of this
event, the conditional

612
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:33,050
probability, should be the
same as the unconditional

613
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:34,430
probability.

614
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:38,850
And we would like a relation
of this kind to be true, no

615
00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:43,480
matter what kind of formula you
write down, as long as the

616
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:47,230
events that show up here are
different from the events that

617
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:49,250
show up there.

618
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:49,770
OK.

619
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:52,150
That's sort of an
ugly definition.

620
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:55,350
The mathematical definition that
actually does the job,

621
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:59,530
and leads to all the
formulas of this

622
00:32:59,530 --> 00:33:01,130
kind, is the following.

623
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:03,610
We're going to say that the
collection of events are

624
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:07,090
independent if we can find the
probability of their joint

625
00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:11,780
occurrence by just multiplying
probabilities.

626
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:17,380
And that will be true even if
you look at sub-collections of

627
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:18,640
these events.

628
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,670
Let's make that more precise.

629
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:24,310
If we have three events, the
definition tells us that the

630
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:27,560
three events are independent
if the following are true.

631
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:31,830
Probability A1 and A2 and A3,
you can calculate this

632
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:34,840
probability by multiplying
individual probabilities.

633
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:38,370

634
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:44,320
But the same is true even if
you take fewer events.

635
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,740
Just a few indices out
of the indices

636
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:48,340
that we have available.

637
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:54,970
So we also require P(A1
intersection A2) is P(A1)

638
00:33:54,970 --> 00:33:57,600
times P(A2).

639
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:01,250
And similarly for the other
possibilities of

640
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:02,500
choosing the indices.

641
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:10,900

642
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:14,659
OK, so independence,
mathematical definition,

643
00:34:14,659 --> 00:34:18,860
requires that calculating
probabilities of any

644
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:22,370
intersection of the events we
have in our hands, that

645
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:25,590
calculation can be done by just
multiplying individual

646
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:27,000
probabilities.

647
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,230
And this has to apply to the
case where we consider all of

648
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:33,300
the events in our hands or just

649
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:36,900
sub-collections of those events.

650
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:42,130
Now these relations just by
themselves are called pairwise

651
00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:44,389
independence.

652
00:34:44,389 --> 00:34:47,179
So this relation, for example,
tells us that A1 is

653
00:34:47,179 --> 00:34:48,710
independent from A2.

654
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:51,130
This tells us that A2 is
independent from A3.

655
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:54,670
This will tell us that A1
is independent from A3.

656
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:58,990
But independence of all the
events together actually

657
00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:01,020
requires a little more.

658
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:05,080
One more equality that has to do
with all three events being

659
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:07,000
considered at the same time.

660
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,562
And this extra equality
is not redundant.

661
00:35:10,562 --> 00:35:13,020
It actually does make
a difference.

662
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:15,390
Independence and pairwise
independence

663
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:17,310
are different things.

664
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:20,320
So let's illustrate the
situation with an example.

665
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,790
Suppose we have two
coin flips.

666
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:28,390
The coin tosses are independent,
so the bias is

667
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:32,910
1/2, so all possible outcomes
have a probability of 1/2

668
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:36,100
times 1/2, which is 1/4.

669
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:40,520
And let's consider now a bunch
of different events.

670
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:46,290
One event is that the
first toss is heads.

671
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:48,950
This is this blue set here.

672
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:54,990
Another event is the second
toss is heads.

673
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:57,970
And this is this black
event here.

674
00:35:57,970 --> 00:36:00,770

675
00:36:00,770 --> 00:36:01,850
OK.

676
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:04,500
Are these two events
independent?

677
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,660
If you check it mathematically,
yes.

678
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:09,270
Probability of A is probability
of B is 1/2.

679
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:13,170
Probability of A times
probability of B is 1/4, which

680
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:16,700
is the same as the probability
of A intersection B,

681
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,070
which is this set.

682
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:20,680
So we have just checked
mathematically that A and B

683
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:22,180
are independent.

684
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:26,210
Now lets consider a third event
which is that the first

685
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:30,080
and second toss give
the same result.

686
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,270
I'll use a different color.

687
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:35,400
First and second toss to
give the same result.

688
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:38,350
This is the event that
we obtain heads,

689
00:36:38,350 --> 00:36:40,700
heads or tails, tails.

690
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:43,030
So this is the probability
of C. What's the

691
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:44,280
probability of C?

692
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:47,790

693
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:51,520
Well, C is made up of two
outcomes, each one of which

694
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:55,500
has probability 1/4, so the
probability of C is 1/2.

695
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:58,600
What is the probability
of C intersection A?

696
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:02,760
C intersection A is just this
one outcome, and has

697
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:06,030
probability 1/4.

698
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:10,040
What's the probability of A
intersection B intersection C?

699
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:13,650
The three events intersect just
this outcome, so this

700
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:15,620
probability is also 1/4.

701
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:18,610

702
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:19,860
OK.

703
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:24,130

704
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:27,060
What's the probability
of C given A and B?

705
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:29,800

706
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:34,840
If A has occurred, and B has
occurred, you are certain that

707
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,980
this outcome here happened.

708
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:40,160
If the first toss is H and the
second toss is H, then you're

709
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,970
certain of the first
and second toss

710
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:43,760
gave the same result.

711
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,500
So the conditional probability
of C given A and

712
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:49,050
B is equal to 1.

713
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:51,640
So do we have independence
in this example?

714
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:54,310

715
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:55,970
We don't.

716
00:37:55,970 --> 00:38:00,210
C, that we obtain the same
result in the first and the

717
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:04,020
second toss, has probability
1/2.

718
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:08,480
Half of the possible outcomes
give us two coin flips with

719
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,700
the same result-- heads,
heads or tails, tails.

720
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,970
So the probability
of C is 1/2.

721
00:38:12,970 --> 00:38:17,590
But if I tell you that the
events A and B both occurred,

722
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:20,900
then you're certain
that C occurred.

723
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:23,190
If I tell you that we had heads
and heads, then you're

724
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:25,460
certain the outcomes
were the same.

725
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:28,830
So the conditional probability
is different from the

726
00:38:28,830 --> 00:38:31,400
unconditional probability.

727
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:37,050
So by combining these two
relations together, we get

728
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:39,235
that the three events
are not independent.

729
00:38:39,235 --> 00:38:42,260

730
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:45,520
But are they pairwise
independent?

731
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:49,020
Is A independent from B?

732
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:53,400
Yes, because probability of A
times probability of B is 1/4,

733
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:58,670
which is probability of
A intersection B. Is C

734
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:02,350
independent from A?

735
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:05,780
Well, the probability
of C and A is 1/4.

736
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:07,620
The probability of C is 1/2.

737
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:09,830
The probability of A is 1/2.

738
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:11,150
So it checks.

739
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:17,960
1/4 is equal to 1/2 and 1/2,
so event C and event A are

740
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,410
independent.

741
00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:24,490
Knowing that the first toss was
heads does not change your

742
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:28,600
beliefs about whether the two
tosses are going to have the

743
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,380
same outcome or not.

744
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:34,200
Knowing that the first was
heads, well, the second is

745
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,520
equally likely to be
heads or tails.

746
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:39,710
So event C has just the
same probability,

747
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:42,140
again, 1/2, to occur.

748
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:46,110
To put it the opposite way,
if I tell you that the two

749
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:47,860
results were the same--

750
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:51,130
so it's either heads, heads
or tails, tails--

751
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:53,070
what does that tell you
about the first toss?

752
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:54,800
Is it heads, or is it tails?

753
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,570
Well, it doesn't tell
you anything.

754
00:39:56,570 --> 00:39:59,700
It could be either over the
two, so the probability of

755
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:04,490
heads in the first toss is equal
to 1/2, and telling you

756
00:40:04,490 --> 00:40:07,460
C occurred does not
change anything.

757
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:10,830
So this is an example that
illustrates the case where we

758
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:14,650
have three events in which
we check that pairwise

759
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:18,140
independence holds for
any combination of

760
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:19,250
two of these events.

761
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,900
We have the probability of their
intersection is equal to

762
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:23,760
the product of their
probabilities.

763
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:27,930
On the other hand, the three
events taken all together are

764
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:29,500
not independent.

765
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:32,780
A doesn't tell me anything
useful, whether C is going to

766
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:34,710
occur or not.

767
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:36,730
B doesn't tell me
anything useful.

768
00:40:36,730 --> 00:40:40,840
But if I tell you that both A
and B occurred, the two of

769
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:44,150
them together tell me something
useful about C.

770
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:47,165
Namely, they tell me that C
certainly has occurred.

771
00:40:47,165 --> 00:40:49,750

772
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:51,000
Very good.

773
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,900

774
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:56,890
So independence is this somewhat
subtle concept.

775
00:40:56,890 --> 00:40:59,710
Once you grasp the intuition of
what it really means, then

776
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:02,910
things perhaps fall in place.

777
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:06,630
But it's a concept where
it's easy to get some

778
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:07,430
misunderstanding.

779
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:11,370
So just take some
time to digest.

780
00:41:11,370 --> 00:41:14,810
So to lighten things up, I'm
going to spend the remaining

781
00:41:14,810 --> 00:41:18,810
four minutes talking about the
very nice, simple problem that

782
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:23,240
involves conditional
probabilities and the like.

783
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:28,140
So here's the problem,
formulated exactly as it shows

784
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:30,250
up in various textbooks.

785
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:31,780
And the formulation says
the following.

786
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:35,310
Well, consider one of those
anachronistic places where

787
00:41:35,310 --> 00:41:40,050
they still have kings or queens,
and where actually

788
00:41:40,050 --> 00:41:43,090
boys take precedence
over girls.

789
00:41:43,090 --> 00:41:44,600
So if there is a boy--

790
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:47,280

791
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:52,400
if the royal family has a boy,
then he will become the king

792
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:58,080
even if he has an older sister
who might be the queen.

793
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:02,930
So we have one of those
royal families.

794
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:06,810
That royal family had two
children, and we know that

795
00:42:06,810 --> 00:42:08,060
there is a king.

796
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:11,370

797
00:42:11,370 --> 00:42:14,250
There is a king, which means
that at least one of the two

798
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:16,030
children was a boy.

799
00:42:16,030 --> 00:42:18,970
Otherwise we wouldn't
have a king.

800
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:21,885
What is the probability that the
king's sibling is female?

801
00:42:21,885 --> 00:42:24,920

802
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,170
OK.

803
00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:28,260

804
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:30,830
I guess we need to make some
assumptions about genetics.

805
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:33,910
Let's assume that every child
is a boy or a girl with

806
00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:39,440
probability 1/2, and that
different children, what they

807
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,900
are is independent from what
the other children were.

808
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:47,660
So every childbirth is basically
a coin flip.

809
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:50,740
OK, so if you take that,
you say, well,

810
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:52,980
the king is a child.

811
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:55,890
His sibling is another child.

812
00:42:55,890 --> 00:42:58,450
Children are independent
of each other.

813
00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:05,860
So the probability that the
sibling is a girl is 1/2.

814
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:07,620
That's the naive answer.

815
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:09,270
Now let's try to
do it formally.

816
00:43:09,270 --> 00:43:12,410
Let's set up a model
of the experiment.

817
00:43:12,410 --> 00:43:15,650
The royal family had two
children, as we we're told, so

818
00:43:15,650 --> 00:43:17,020
there's four outcomes--

819
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:22,040
boy boy, boy girl, girl
boy, and girl girl.

820
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:26,520
Now, we are told that there is
a king, which means what?

821
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:29,530
This outcome here
did not happen.

822
00:43:29,530 --> 00:43:30,760
It is not possible.

823
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:33,810
There are three outcomes
that remain possible.

824
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:37,940
So this is our conditional
sample space given

825
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:40,500
that there is king.

826
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:43,170
What are the probabilities
for the original model?

827
00:43:43,170 --> 00:43:46,420
Well with the model that we
assume that every child is a

828
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:50,885
boy or a girl independently with
probability 1/2, then the

829
00:43:50,885 --> 00:43:54,950
four outcomes would be equally
likely, and they're like this.

830
00:43:54,950 --> 00:43:57,110
These are the original
probabilities.

831
00:43:57,110 --> 00:44:00,810
But once we are told that this
outcome did not happen,

832
00:44:00,810 --> 00:44:03,900
because we have a king, then
we are transported to the

833
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:05,830
smaller sample space.

834
00:44:05,830 --> 00:44:08,380
In this sample space, what's
the probability that the

835
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:10,360
sibling is a girl?

836
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:15,160
Well the sibling is a girl in
two out of the three outcomes.

837
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:17,290
So the probability that
the sibling is a

838
00:44:17,290 --> 00:44:21,880
girl is actually 2/3.

839
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:25,780
So that's supposed to
be the right answer.

840
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:29,620
Maybe a little
counter-intuitive.

841
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:32,960
So you can play smart and say,
oh I understand such problems

842
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:35,990
better than you, here is a trick
problem and here's why

843
00:44:35,990 --> 00:44:37,800
the answer is 2/3.

844
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:41,300
But actually I'm not fully
justified in saying that the

845
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:42,930
answer is 2/3.

846
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:46,520
I made lots of hidden
assumptions when I put this

847
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:50,040
model down, which I
didn't yet state.

848
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:54,960
So to reverse engineer this
answer, let's actually think

849
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,960
what's the probability model for
which this would have been

850
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:59,320
the right answer.

851
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:01,300
And here's the probability
model.

852
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:02,800
The royal family--

853
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:07,050
the royal parents decided to
have exactly two children.

854
00:45:07,050 --> 00:45:08,960
They went and had them.

855
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:11,670
It turned out that at
least one was a boy

856
00:45:11,670 --> 00:45:13,390
and became a king.

857
00:45:13,390 --> 00:45:15,580
Under this scenario--

858
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:18,070
that they decide to have
exactly two children--

859
00:45:18,070 --> 00:45:20,840
then this is the big
sample space.

860
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:23,350
It turned out that
one was a boy.

861
00:45:23,350 --> 00:45:25,560
That eliminates this outcome.

862
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:27,410
And then this picture
is correct and this

863
00:45:27,410 --> 00:45:28,750
is the right answer.

864
00:45:28,750 --> 00:45:31,680
But there's hidden assumptions
being there.

865
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:35,170
How about if the royal
family had followed

866
00:45:35,170 --> 00:45:37,230
the following strategy?

867
00:45:37,230 --> 00:45:41,760
We're going to have children
until we get a boy, so that we

868
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:45,700
get a king, and then
we'll stop.

869
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:47,660
OK, given they have two
children, what's the

870
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:50,660
probability that the
sibling is a girl?

871
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:51,880
It's 1.

872
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:55,260
The reason that they had two
children was because the first

873
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:57,800
was a girl, so they had
to have a second.

874
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:00,820
So assumptions about
reproductive practices

875
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:03,130
actually need to come in,
and they're going

876
00:46:03,130 --> 00:46:04,630
to affect the decisions.

877
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:08,010
Or, if it's one of those ancient
kingdoms where a king

878
00:46:08,010 --> 00:46:11,790
would always make sure too
strangle any of his brothers,

879
00:46:11,790 --> 00:46:15,560
then the probability that the
sibling is a girl is actually

880
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:17,570
1 again, and so on.

881
00:46:17,570 --> 00:46:20,590
So it means that one needs to be
careful when you start with

882
00:46:20,590 --> 00:46:24,330
loosely worded problems to
make sure exactly what it

883
00:46:24,330 --> 00:46:26,950
means and what assumptions
you're making.

884
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:28,880
All right, see you next week.

885
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:30,130
