1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,390

2
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:01,370
Hi.

3
00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:03,330
In this problem, we're going
to get a bunch of practice

4
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:05,710
working with multiple random
variables together.

5
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:09,200
And so we'll look at joint
PDFs, marginal PDFs,

6
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,000
conditional PDFs, and also get
some practice calculating

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,420
expectations as well.

8
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:20,800
So the problem gives us a pair
of random variables-- x and y.

9
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,340
And we're told that the joint
distribution is uniformly

10
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:31,010
distributed on this triangle
here, with the vertices being

11
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:34,180
0, 0 1, 0, and 0, 1.

12
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:37,180
So it's uniform in
this triangle.

13
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:39,640
And the first part of the
problem is just to figure out

14
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:45,280
what exactly is disjoint PDF of
the two random variables.

15
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,720
So in this case, it's pretty
easy to calculate, because we

16
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,320
have a uniform distribution.

17
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,710
And remember, when you have a
uniform distribution, you can

18
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:55,540
just imagine it being
a sort of plateau

19
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:56,720
coming out of the board.

20
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:57,800
And it's flat.

21
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,827
And so the height of the
plateau, in order to calculate

22
00:01:01,827 --> 00:01:04,849
it, you just need to figure
out what the area of this

23
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:06,630
thing is, of this triangle is.

24
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:09,010
So remember, when you had single
random variables, what

25
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:13,380
we had to do was calculate, for
uniform distribution, we

26
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:14,910
had to integrate to 1.

27
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:17,860
So you took the length, and you
took 1 over the length was

28
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:19,770
the correct scaling factor.

29
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:24,460
Here, you take the area.

30
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:28,610
And the height has to make it so
that the entire volume here

31
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:30,520
integrates to 1.

32
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:33,810
So the joint PDF is just
going to be 1 over

33
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:34,960
whatever this area is.

34
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,550
And the area is pretty
simple to calculate.

35
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:38,480
It's 1/2 base times height.

36
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,390
So it's 1/2.

37
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:42,960
And so what we have is
that the area is 1/2.

38
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:52,100
And so the joint PDF of x and
y is going to equal 2.

39
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:56,320
But remember, you always have
to be careful when writing

40
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,860
these things to remember
the ranges when

41
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,930
these things are valid.

42
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:03,690
So it's only 2 within
this triangle.

43
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,650
And outside of the
triangle, it's 0.

44
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:09,070
So what exactly does inside
the triangle mean?

45
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:12,510
Well, we can write it
more mathematically.

46
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:19,980
So this diagonal line, it's
given by x plus y equals 1.

47
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:23,890
So everything in the triangle
is really x plus y is less

48
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:24,490
than or equal to 1.

49
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:26,680
It means everything under
this triangle.

50
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:30,660
And so we need x plus y to be
less then or equal to 1 and

51
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:33,305
also x to be non-negative and
y to be non-negative.

52
00:02:33,305 --> 00:02:36,400

53
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,830
So with these inequalities,
that captures everything

54
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:41,020
within this triangle.

55
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:47,020
And otherwise, the joint
PDF is going to be 0.

56
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:49,890

57
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:54,280
The next part asks us to find,
using this joint PDF, the

58
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,140
marginal of y.

59
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:59,600
And remember, when you have
a joint PDF of two random

60
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,580
variables, you essentially have
everything that you need,

61
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,620
because from this joint PDF, you
can calculate marginals,

62
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,840
you can calculate from the
margins, you can calculate

63
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,980
conditionals.

64
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,000
The joint PDF captures
everything that there is to

65
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,980
know about this pair of
random variables.

66
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:17,620
Now, to calculate a marginal PDF
of y, remember a marginal

67
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:20,880
really just means collapsing
the other

68
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,300
random variable down.

69
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,770
And so you can just imagine
taking this thing and

70
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:28,460
collapsing it down
onto the y-axis.

71
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:33,900
And mathematically, that is just
saying that we integrate

72
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:38,710
out the other random variable.

73
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:41,250

74
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,910
So the other random variable
in this case will be x.

75
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:47,020
We take x and we get rid of
it by integrating out from

76
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:49,640
negative infinity to infinity.

77
00:03:49,640 --> 00:04:01,130
Of course, this joint PDF
is 0 in a lot of places.

78
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:04,240
And so a lot of these
will be 0.

79
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,710
And only for a certain range
of x's will this integral

80
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:10,330
actually be non-zero.

81
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:13,740
And so again, the other time
when we have to be careful is

82
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:16,500
when we have these limits of
integration, we need to make

83
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,720
sure that we have the
right limits.

84
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,150
And so we know that the
joint PDF is 2.

85
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:25,010
It's nonzero only within
this triangle.

86
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:33,810
And so it's only 2 within
this triangle, which

87
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:36,130
means what for x?

88
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:39,120
Well, depending on what
x and y are, this will

89
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,380
be either 2 or 0.

90
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:44,360
So let's just fix
some value of y.

91
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:49,550
Pretend that we've picked some
value y, let's say here.

92
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:52,170
We want this value of y.

93
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:56,660
Well, what are the values of x
such that the joint PDF for

94
00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:00,950
that value y is actually
nonzero, it's actually 2?

95
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:05,310
Well, it's everything from
x equals 0 to whatever

96
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:06,520
x value this is.

97
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,680
But this x value, actually, if
you think about it, is just 1

98
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,840
minus y, because this line
is x plus y equals 1.

99
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,880
So whatever y is, x is going
to be 1 minus that.

100
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:21,010
And so the correct limits
would actually be from

101
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:23,040
0 to 1 minus y.

102
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,120

103
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,890
And then the rest of that
is pretty simple.

104
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:29,850
You integrate this.

105
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:31,650
This is a pretty simple
integral.

106
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:35,570
And you get that it's actually
two times 1 minus y.

107
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:36,820
That's a y.

108
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:40,930

109
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:46,340
But of course, again, we need to
make sure that we have the

110
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:48,260
right regions.

111
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:51,590
So this is not always true
for y, of course.

112
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:58,380
This is only true for
y between 0 and 1.

113
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:04,690
And otherwise, it's actually 0,
because when you take a y

114
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:08,890
down here, well, there's no
values of x that will give you

115
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:10,550
a nonzero joint PDF.

116
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:13,000
And if you take a value of y
higher than this, the same

117
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,250
thing happens.

118
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:16,610

119
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:18,900
So we can actually draw
this out and see

120
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,720
what it looks like.

121
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,480
So let's actually draw
a small picture here.

122
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,440
Here's y.

123
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,900
Here's the marginal PDF of y.

124
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:32,530
And here's 2.

125
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:34,123
And it actually looks
like this.

126
00:06:34,123 --> 00:06:40,760
It's a triangle and a 0
outside this range.

127
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,010
So does that make sense?

128
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:49,870
Well, first of all, you see
that actually does in fact

129
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:51,730
integrates to 1,
which is good.

130
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:57,980
And the other thing we notice
is that there is a higher

131
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:00,010
density for smaller
values of y.

132
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:00,950
So why is that?

133
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:03,500
Why are smaller values
of y more likely than

134
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,720
larger values of y?

135
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,830
Well, because when you have
smaller values of

136
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:10,770
y, you're down here.

137
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:14,520
And it's more likely because
there are more values of x

138
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:18,400
that go along with it that
make that value of y more

139
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,350
likely to appear.

140
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:21,630
Say you have a large
value of y.

141
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:22,850
Then you're up here
at the tip.

142
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:25,660
Well, there aren't very many
combinations of x and y that

143
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:28,010
give you that large
a value of y.

144
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:31,700
And so that large value of
y becomes less likely.

145
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,420
Another way to think about it
is, when you collapse this

146
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:38,440
down, there's a lot more stuff
to collapse down its base.

147
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,560
There's a lot of x's
to collapse down.

148
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,175
But up here, there's only a
very little bit of x to

149
00:07:44,175 --> 00:07:44,550
collapse down.

150
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:49,280
And the PDF of y becomes
more skewed towards

151
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,530
smaller values of y.

152
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:55,450

153
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:59,560
So now, the next thing that we
want to do is calculate the

154
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,850
conditional PDF of x, given y.

155
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:07,490
Well, let's just recall
what that means.

156
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:09,480
This is what we're looking for--
the conditional PDF of

157
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,490
x, given y.

158
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:17,380
And remember, this is calculated
by taking the joint

159
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:19,180
and dividing by the
marginal of y.

160
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:22,220

161
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:25,460
So we actually have the
top and the bottom.

162
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:28,760
We have to joint PDF from part
A. And from part B, we

163
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,630
calculated the marginal
PDF of y.

164
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:33,309
So we have both pieces.

165
00:08:33,309 --> 00:08:38,230
So let's actually
plug them in.

166
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:42,450
Again, the thing that you have
to be careful here is about

167
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:46,410
the ranges of x and y where
these things are valid,

168
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:50,770
because this is only non-zero
when x and y

169
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:52,410
fall within this triangle.

170
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:57,070
And this is only non-zero when
y is between 0 and 1.

171
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:59,510
So we need to be careful.

172
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:03,360
So the top, when it's
non-zero, it's 2.

173
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,720
And the bottom, when it's
non-zero, it's 2

174
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,790
times 1 minus y.

175
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:14,270
So we can simplify that to
be 1 over 1 minus y.

176
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:16,250
And when is this true?

177
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:23,240
Well, it's true when x and y are
in the triangle and y is

178
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:26,040
between 0 and 1.

179
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:30,400
So put another way, that means
that this is valid when y is

180
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:50,380
between 0 and 1 and x is between
0 and 1 minus y,

181
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:54,540
because whatever x has to be,
it has to be such that they

182
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:57,860
actually still fall within
this triangle.

183
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:03,150
And outside of this, it's 0.

184
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:06,690

185
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:09,970
So let's see what this
actually looks like.

186
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:14,710

187
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:21,140
So this is x, and this is the
conditional PDF of x, given y.

188
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:24,160

189
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,410
Let's say this is
1 right here.

190
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:33,100

191
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:37,480
Then what it's saying is, let's
say we're given that y

192
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,280
is some little y.

193
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:41,810
Let's say it's somewhere here.

194
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:46,050
Then it's saying that the
conditional PDF of x given y

195
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:47,350
is this thing.

196
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:50,790
But notice that this value,
1 over 1 minus y, does not

197
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:52,030
depend on x.

198
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:56,090
So in fact, it actually
is uniform.

199
00:10:56,090 --> 00:11:03,360
So it's uniform between
0 and 1 minus y.

200
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:11,560
And the height is something
like 1 over 1 minus y.

201
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:15,810
And this is so that the scaling
makes it so that

202
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:23,100
actually is a valid PDF, because
the integral is to 1.

203
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,030
So why is the case?

204
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:28,340
Why is that when you condition
on y being some value, you get

205
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:32,690
that the PDF of x is
actually uniform?

206
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:35,370
Well, when you look over here,
let's again just pretend that

207
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:37,070
you're taking this value of y.

208
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:41,290
Well, when you're conditioning
on y being this value, you're

209
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:45,640
basically taking a slice of this
joint PDF at this point.

210
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:49,350
But remember, the original
joint PDF was uniform.

211
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:52,830
So when you take a slice of a
uniform distribution, joint

212
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:54,070
uniform distribution,
you still get

213
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:55,480
something that is uniform.

214
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:59,300
Just imagine that you have
a cake that is flat.

215
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:02,080
Now, you take a slice
at this level.

216
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:05,810
Then whatever slice you have
is also going to be imagine

217
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:08,320
being a flat rectangle.

218
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,520
So it's still going
to be uniform.

219
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:13,840
And that's why the conditional
PDF of x

220
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,100
given y is also uniform.

221
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:19,500

222
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:25,780
Part D now asks us to find a
conditional expectation of x.

223
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:30,000
So we want to find the
expectation of x, given that y

224
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,320
is some little y.

225
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:37,610
And for this, we can
use the definition.

226
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:40,720
Remember, expectations are
really just weighted sums.

227
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,210
Or in the [? continuous ?]
case, it's an integral.

228
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:48,390
So you take the value.

229
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:51,700
And then you weight
it by the density.

230
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:54,410
And in this case, because we're
taking conditional a

231
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:59,250
expectation, what we weight it
by is the conditional density.

232
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:02,440
So it's the conditional
density of x given

233
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,526
that y is little y.

234
00:13:04,526 --> 00:13:06,470
We integrate with
respect to x.

235
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:09,800

236
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,440
And fortunately, we know what
this conditional PDF is,

237
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:17,380
because we calculated it earlier
in part C. And we know

238
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,530
that it's this--

239
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:20,240
1 over 1 minus y.

240
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:25,930
But again, we have to be
careful, because this formula,

241
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:29,590
1 over 1 minus y, is only
valid certain cases.

242
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:31,230
So let's think about
this first.

243
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:32,620
Let's think about some
extreme cases.

244
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:36,450
What if y, little
y, is negative?

245
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:38,740
If little y is negative,
we're conditioning on

246
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:41,480
something over here.

247
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:48,620
And so there is no density for
y being negative or for y,

248
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:51,640
say, in other cases when
y is greater than 1.

249
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:54,790
And so in those cases, this
expectation is just undefined,

250
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:57,780
because conditioning on that
doesn't really make sense,

251
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:02,910
because there's no density
for those values of y.

252
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:06,560
Now, let's consider the case
that actually makes, sense

253
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,120
where y is between 0 and 1.

254
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,500
Now, we're in business, because
that is the range

255
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,010
where this formula is valid.

256
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:17,870
So this formula is valid,
and we can plug it in.

257
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:21,760
So it's 1 over 1 minus y dx.

258
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,665
And then the final thing that we
again need to check is what

259
00:14:24,665 --> 00:14:27,270
the limits of this
integration is.

260
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:29,610
So we're integrating
with respect to x.

261
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:33,810
So we need to write down what
values of x, what ranges of x

262
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:36,560
is this conditional PDF valid.

263
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,070
Well, luckily, we specified
that here.

264
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:43,072
x has to be between
0 and 1 minus y.

265
00:14:43,072 --> 00:14:46,200

266
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:52,310
So let's actually calculate
this integral.

267
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:56,660
This 1 over 1 minus y is a
constant with respect to x.

268
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,090
You can just pull that out.

269
00:14:58,090 --> 00:15:01,130
And then now, you're really
just integrating x from

270
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:02,970
0 to 1 minus y.

271
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:06,530
So the integral of x is
[? 1 ?], 1/2x squared.

272
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:10,960
So you get a 1/2x squared, and
you integrate that from

273
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,580
0 to 1 minus y.

274
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:14,600
And so when you plug in
the limits, you'll

275
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:18,200
get a 1 minus y squared.

276
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,550
That will cancel out the
1 over 1 minus y.

277
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:24,570
And what you're left with is
just 1 minus y over 2.

278
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:28,600

279
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,780
And again, we have to specify
that this is only true for y

280
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:34,650
between 0 and 1.

281
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:39,720
Now, we can again actually
verify that this makes sense.

282
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,450
What we're really looking for is
the conditional expectation

283
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:44,870
of x given some value of y.

284
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:47,750
And we already said that
condition on y being some

285
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:50,800
value of x is uniformly
distributed between

286
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,700
0 and 1 minus y.

287
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,190
And so remember for our uniform
distribution, the

288
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:56,140
expectation is simple.

289
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:57,310
It's just the midpoint.

290
00:15:57,310 --> 00:16:00,550
So the midpoint of 0
and 1 minus y is

291
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:02,350
exactly 1 minus y/2.

292
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:05,340
So that's a nice way of
verifying that this answer is

293
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,590
actually correct.

294
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:09,450

295
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:15,740
Now, the second part of
part D asks us to do

296
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:16,990
a little bit more.

297
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:20,060

298
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:26,000
We have to use the total
expectation theorem in order

299
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,510
to somehow write the expectation
of x in terms of

300
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:30,760
the expectation of y.

301
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,560

302
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:36,510
So the first thing we'll
do is use the

303
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:37,880
total expectation theorem.

304
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:41,630
So the total expectation theorem
is just saying, well,

305
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:44,970
we can take these conditional
expectations.

306
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:54,420
And now, we can integrate this
by the marginal density of y,

307
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:58,080
then we'll get the actual
expectation of x.

308
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:02,115
You can think of it as just kind
of applying the law of

309
00:17:02,115 --> 00:17:03,365
iterated expectations as well.

310
00:17:03,365 --> 00:17:06,490

311
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:12,990
So this integral is going
to look like this.

312
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:17,329
You take the conditional
expectation.

313
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:22,569
So this is the expectation of x
if y were equal to little y.

314
00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:26,260
And now, what is that
probability?

315
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:30,370
Well, now we just multiply that
by the density of y at

316
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:32,830
that actual value of little y.

317
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:34,310
And we integrate with
respect to y.

318
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:37,470

319
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:39,540
Now, we've already calculated
what this conditional

320
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:40,700
expectation is.

321
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,100
It's 1 minus y/2.

322
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:45,430
So let's plug that in.

323
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:49,680
1 minus y/2 times the
marginal of y.

324
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:55,540

325
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:58,010
There's a couple ways of
attacking this problem now.

326
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:00,310
One way is, we can actually
just plug in

327
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:01,490
that marginal of y.

328
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:06,710
We've already calculated that
out in part B. And then we can

329
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:09,570
do this integral and calculate
out the expectation.

330
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:13,230
But maybe we don't really want
to do so much calculus.

331
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:15,190
So let's do what the
problem says and

332
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:16,710
try a different approach.

333
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:20,870
So what the problem suggests is
to write this in terms of

334
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:22,450
the expectation of y.

335
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:23,960
And what is the expectation
of y?

336
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:28,370
Well, the expectation of y is
going to look something like

337
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:33,010
the integral of y times
the marginal of y.

338
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:35,220
So let's see if we can identify
something like that

339
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,500
and pull it out.

340
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,630
Well, yeah, we actually
do have that.

341
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:42,070
We have y times the marginal
of y, integrated.

342
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:44,700
So let's isolate that.

343
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:48,660
So besides that, we
also have this.

344
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:57,930
We have the integral of the
first term, is 1/2 times the

345
00:18:57,930 --> 00:18:59,320
marginal of y.

346
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:04,320
And then the second term is
minus 1/2 times the integral

347
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:10,580
of y of dy.

348
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:13,000
This is just me splitting
this integral up into

349
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,980
two separate integrals.

350
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,690
Now, we know what this is.

351
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:18,950
The 1/2 we can pull out.

352
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:21,870
And then the rest of it is
just the integral of a

353
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:24,540
marginal of a density from minus
infinity to infinity.

354
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:27,810
And by definition, that
has to be equal to 1.

355
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:32,250
So this just gives us a 1/2.

356
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:33,820
And now, what is this?

357
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:35,130
We get a minus 1/2.

358
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:39,290
And now this, we already said
that is the expectation of y.

359
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:44,060
So what we have is the
expectation of y.

360
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:49,500
So in the second part of this
part D, we've expressed the

361
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:53,050
expectation of x in terms
of the expectation of y.

362
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:56,520
Now, maybe that seems like
that's not too helpful,

363
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:59,710
because we don't know what
either of those two are.

364
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:04,170
But if we think about this
problem, and as part E

365
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:07,190
suggests, we can see that
there's symmetry in this

366
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:12,420
problem, because x and y are
essentially symmetric.

367
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:16,740
So imagine this is x equals y.

368
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:20,430
There's symmetry in this
problem, because if you were

369
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:24,530
to swap the roles of x and y,
you would have exactly the

370
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:26,510
same joint PDF.

371
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:31,660
So what that suggests is that
by symmetry then, it must be

372
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:36,060
that the expectation of x and
the expectation of y are

373
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:39,230
exactly the same.

374
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:41,080
And that is using the
symmetry argument.

375
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:45,850
And that helps us now, because
we can plug that in and solve

376
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:46,920
for expectation of x.

377
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:54,340
So expectation of x is 1/2 minus
1/2 expectation of x.

378
00:20:54,340 --> 00:21:00,860
So we have 3/2 expectation
of x equals 1/2.

379
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:05,810
So expectation of
x equals 1/3.

380
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:09,770
And of course, expectation
of y is also 1/3.

381
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:14,970
And so it turns out that the
expectation is around there.

382
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:17,760

383
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:21,220
So this problem had
several parts.

384
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:26,120
And it allowed us to start
out from just a raw joint

385
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,840
distribution, calculate
marginals, calculate

386
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,650
conditionals, and then from
there, calculate all kinds of

387
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:34,530
conditional expectations
and expectations.

388
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:39,020
And a couple of important points
to remember are, when

389
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:42,620
you do these joint
distributions, it's very

390
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:47,230
important to consider where
values are valid.

391
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:50,340
So you have to keep in mind
when you write out these

392
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:55,620
conditional PDFs and joint PDFs
and marginal PDFs, what

393
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:59,590
ranges the formulas you
calculated are valid for.

394
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:02,880
And that also translates to
when you're calculating

395
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,930
expectations and such.

396
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:06,805
When you have integrals, you
need to be very careful about

397
00:22:06,805 --> 00:22:08,590
the limits of your integration,
to make sure that

398
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:12,290
they line up with the range
where the values

399
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:13,860
are actually valid.

400
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:17,180
And the last thing, which is
kind of unrelated, but it is

401
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:20,890
actually a common tool that's
used in a lot of problems is,

402
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:25,170
when you see symmetry in these
problems, that can help a lot,

403
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:28,590
because it will simplify things
and allow you to use

404
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:31,330
facts like these to help
you calculate what the

405
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:32,190
final answer is.

406
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:35,520
Of course, this is also comes
along with practice.

407
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,620
You may not immediately see that
there could be a symmetry

408
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:39,120
argument that will help
with this problem.

409
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,680
But with practice, when you do
more of these problems, you'll

410
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,440
eventually build up
that kind of--

411
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,690
