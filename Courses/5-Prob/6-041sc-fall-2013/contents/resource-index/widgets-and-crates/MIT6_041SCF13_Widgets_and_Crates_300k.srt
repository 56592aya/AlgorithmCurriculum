00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,970

2
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:02,080
Hi.

3
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:03,810
In this problem, we'll get
more practice using

4
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:05,210
conditioning to help
us calculate

5
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:07,090
expectations of variances.

6
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:09,500
We'll see that in this problem,
which deals with

7
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,170
widgets and crates, it's
actually similar in flavor to

8
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:14,130
an earlier problem that we
did, involving breaking a

9
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:15,616
stick twice.

10
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:18,560
And you'll see that in this
problem, we'll again use the

11
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,590
law of iterated expectations and
the law of total variance

12
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:24,450
to help us calculate
expectations of variances.

13
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:27,500
And again, we'll be taking the
approach of attacking the

14
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:30,910
problem by splitting into the
stages and building up from

15
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:32,840
the bottom up.

16
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,370
So in this problem, what we
have is a crate, which

17
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,220
contains some number of boxes.

18
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:40,210
And we don't know how
many boxes are.

19
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:40,940
It's random.

20
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:45,200
And it's given by some discrete
random variable, n.

21
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,990
And in each box, there are
some number of widgets.

22
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:50,840
And again, this is
also random.

23
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:56,240
And in each box, say for Box
I, there are xi number of

24
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,750
widgets in each one.

25
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:01,120
What we're really interested
in in this problem is, how

26
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,800
many widgets are there
total in this crate?

27
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,330
So in the crate, there are
boxes, and in the boxes, there

28
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:06,820
are widgets.

29
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:10,160
How many widgets are there
total within the crate?

30
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,680
And we'll call that a
random variable, t.

31
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,320
And the problem gives
us some information.

32
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,200
It tells us that the expectation
of the number of

33
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,930
widgets in each box for all
the boxes is the same.

34
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:22,930
It's 10.

35
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:25,650
And also, the expectation
of the number of

36
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:27,760
boxes is also 10.

37
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,790
And furthermore, the variance of
x of the number of widgets

38
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:34,140
and the number of
boxes is all 16.

39
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:38,070
And lastly, an important fact
is that all the xi's, so all

40
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:41,730
the widgets for each box, and
the total number of boxes,

41
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:45,590
these random variables
are all independent.

42
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:54,520
So to calculate t, t is just
a sum of x1 through xn.

43
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,800
So x1 is the number of widgets
in Box 1, z2 is the number of

44
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:01,050
widgets in Box 2, and all
the way through Box n.

45
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:03,660
So what makes this difficult
is that the

46
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,060
n is actually random.

47
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,200
We don't actually know how
many boxes there are.

48
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,070
So we don't even know how many
terms there are in the sum.

49
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:14,670
Well, let's take a slightly
simpler problem.

50
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:16,290
Let's pretend that we
actually know there

51
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:18,690
are exactly 12 boxes.

52
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:23,180
And in that case, the only thing
that's random now is how

53
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,280
many widgets there
are in each box.

54
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:30,170
And so let's call [? sum ?] a
new random variable, s, the

55
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:31,920
sum of x1 through x12.

56
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,540
So this would tell us,
this is the number of

57
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:37,910
widgets in 12 boxes.

58
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:38,900
All right.

59
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:42,280
And because each of these xi's
are independent, and they have

60
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,260
the same expectation, just by
linearity of expectations, we

61
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:51,740
know that the expectation of s
is just 12 copies of the same

62
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:54,220
expectation of xi.

63
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:57,500
And similarly, because we also
assume that all the xi's are

64
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:01,100
independent, the variance of
s, we can just add the

65
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,530
variances of each
of these terms.

66
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:06,610
So again, there are 12 copies
of the variance of xi.

67
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:09,010
So we've done a simpler version
of this problem, where

68
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:12,910
we've assumed we know what
n is, that n is 12.

69
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:16,000
And we've seen that in this
simpler case, it's pretty

70
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,850
simple to calculate what the
expectation of the sum is.

71
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:22,640
So let's try to use that
knowledge to help us calculate

72
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,840
the actual problem, where
n is actually random.

73
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,420

74
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:35,080
So what we'll do is use the law
of iterated expectations.

75
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:38,220
And so this is written in terms
of x and y, but we can

76
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:41,010
very easily just substitute in
for the random variables that

77
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:41,610
we care about.

78
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:46,690
Where in this case, what we see
is that in order to build

79
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:52,510
things up, it would be helpful
if we condition on something

80
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:54,360
that is useful.

81
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,940
And in this case, it's fairly
clear that it would be helpful

82
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:00,340
if we condition on n,
the number of boxes.

83
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,960
So if we knew how many boxes
there were, then we can drop

84
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,610
down to the level of widgets
within each box.

85
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:08,410
And then once we have that, we
can build up and average over

86
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:11,060
the total number of boxes.

87
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:14,100
So what we should do
is condition on n,

88
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,370
the number of boxes.

89
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:19,820
So what have we discovered
through this

90
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,269
simpler exercise earlier?

91
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:25,310
Well, we've discovered that if
we knew the number of boxes,

92
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:27,650
then the expectation of the
total number of widgets is

93
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:30,870
just the number of boxes times
the number of widgets in each

94
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,850
one, or the expectation of the
number of widgets in each one.

95
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:39,680
So we can use that information
to help us here.

96
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:45,590
Because now, this is basically
the same scenario, except that

97
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:47,360
the number of boxes
is now random.

98
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,010
Instead of being 12, it
could be anything.

99
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:55,090
But if we just condition on
the number of boxes being

100
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:57,040
equal to n, then we know
that there are

101
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,550
exactly n copies of this.

102
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:02,090
But notice that n here
is still random.

103
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:08,370
And so what we get is that the
expectation is n times the

104
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:10,940
expectation of the number of
widgets in each box, which we

105
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:11,990
know is 10.

106
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:17,830
So it's expectation of 10
times n or 10 times the

107
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:22,210
expectation of n, which
gives us 100.

108
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:27,040
Because there are, on
expectation, 10 boxes.

109
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,850
So this, again, makes
intuitive sense.

110
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:31,860
Because we know that on average,
there are 10 boxes.

111
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:35,650
And on average, each box
has 10 widgets inside.

112
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:37,330
And so on average,
we expect that

113
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:39,260
there will be 100 widgets.

114
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:42,120
And the key thing here is that
we actually relied on this

115
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:42,920
independence.

116
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:47,750
So if the number of widgets in
each box vary depending on--

117
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:50,640
or if the distribution of the
number of widgets in each box

118
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,170
vary depending on how many
boxes there were, then we

119
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:54,790
wouldn't be able to
do it this simply.

120
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:57,850

121
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:01,980
OK, so that gives us the answer
to the first part, the

122
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:04,200
expectation of the total
number of widgets.

123
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:08,820
Now let's do the second part,
which is the variance.

124
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:14,850
The variance, we'll again use
this idea of conditioning and

125
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:17,810
splitting things up, and use
the law of total variance.

126
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:22,460
So the variance of t is going to
be equal to the expectation

127
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:31,560
of the conditional variance
plus the variance of the

128
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,810
conditional expectation.

129
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:35,100

130
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,840
So what we have to do now is
just to calculate what all of

131
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,380
these pieces are.

132
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:41,810
So let's start with
this thing here,

133
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:43,910
the conditional variance.

134
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:45,510
So what is the conditional
variance?

135
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:48,640

136
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:51,690
Well, again, let's go back
to our simpler case.

137
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:55,530
We know that if we knew what n
is, then the variance would

138
00:06:55,530 --> 00:07:01,600
just be n times the variance
of each xi.

139
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,860
So what does that tell us?

140
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:06,240
That tells us that, well, if
we knew what n was, so

141
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,180
condition on n, the variance
would just be n times the

142
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:14,440
variance of each xi.

143
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:18,350
So we've just taken this analogy
and generalized it to

144
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:19,940
the case where we don't actually
know what n is.

145
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:23,370
We just condition on n, and we
still have a random variable.

146
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:26,160

147
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,340
So then from that, we know that
the expectation now, to

148
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:32,840
get this first term, take
the expectation of this

149
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:40,030
conditional variance, it's just
the expectation of n and

150
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:42,120
the variance of xi,
we're given that.

151
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,720
That's equal to 16.

152
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:49,430
So it's n times 16, which we
know is 160, because the

153
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:53,030
expectation of n, we
also know, is 10.

154
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:56,130
All right, let's do this
second term now.

155
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:57,680
We need the variance
of the conditional

156
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,270
expectation of t given n.

157
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:05,990
Well, what is the conditional
expectation of t given n?

158
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:08,100
We've already kind of
used that here.

159
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:12,600
And again, it's using the fact
that if we knew what n was,

160
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:16,340
the expectation would just be n
times the expectation of the

161
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:18,040
number of widgets in each box.

162
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,800
So it would be n times the
expectation of each xi.

163
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,590

164
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:25,490
Now, to get the second
term, we just take

165
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:27,100
the variance of this.

166
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:36,350
So the variance is the variance
of n times the

167
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:37,909
expectation of each xi.

168
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:41,330
And the expectation
of each xi is 10.

169
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:43,679
So it's n times 10.

170
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,540
And now remember, when you
calculate variances,

171
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,810
[? if you ?] have a constant
term inside, when you pull it

172
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:49,700
out, you have to square it.

173
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:54,090
So you get 100 times
the variance of n.

174
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:57,030
And we know that the variance
of n is also 16.

175
00:08:57,030 --> 00:09:01,340
So this gives us 1600.

176
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:01,630
All right.

177
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:04,140
So now we've calculated
both terms here.

178
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,610
The first term is
equal to 160.

179
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:07,570
The second term is
equal to 1600.

180
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:09,290
So to get the final answer,
all we have to

181
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:11,240
do is add this up.

182
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:17,890
So we get that the final answer
is equal to 1760.

183
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:21,480
And this is not as obvious as
the expectation, where you

184
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,965
could have just kind
of guessed that it

185
00:09:22,965 --> 00:09:24,570
was equal to 100.

186
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:28,320
So again, this was just another
example of using

187
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,220
conditioning and the laws of
total variance and iterated

188
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:34,360
expectations in order to help
you solve a problem.

189
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:38,600
And in this case, you could kind
of see that there is a

190
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,340
hierarchy, where you
start with widgets.

191
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:43,920
Widgets are contained in boxes,
and then crates contain

192
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,080
some number of boxes.

193
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:49,260
And so it's easy to
just condition and

194
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,140
do it level by level.

195
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:52,210
So you condition on the
number of boxes.

196
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:54,620
If you know what the number of
boxes are, then you can easily

197
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:57,320
calculate how many widgets
there are, on average.

198
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,300
And then you average over the
number of boxes to get the

199
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,970
final answer.

200
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:03,020
So I hope that was helpful.

201
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,270
And we'll see you next time.

202
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:07,334
