00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,245

2
00:00:01,245 --> 00:00:04,350
Hi, In this problem, we'll
be looking at the PDF the

3
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:06,660
absolute value of x.

4
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:10,330
So if we know a random variable,
x, and we know it's

5
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:14,180
PDF, how can we use that
information to help us find

6
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:16,280
the PDF of another random
variable-- the

7
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:18,090
absolute value of x?

8
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:21,210
And so throughout this problem,
we'll define a new

9
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:22,450
random variable called y.

10
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:26,100
And we'll define that y to be
equal to the absolute value of

11
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,950
x, just to make things
simpler.

12
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:32,439
So we'll do a couple of concrete
examples, and then

13
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:34,320
we'll try to generalize
at the end.

14
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,830
The first example that we'll
deal with in part A is

15
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:39,040
this PDF for x.

16
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,000
So we're told that the PDF of
x is 1/3 between negative 2

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,650
and 1, and 0 otherwise.

18
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:47,420
And here's a picture of
what it looks like.

19
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:52,110
It's just a rectangle from
negative 2 to 1.

20
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:55,220
So now we want to find out
what is the PDF of the

21
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:58,140
absolute value of x, which
we've called y?

22
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:02,210
And at this point, it may be
helpful to step back and think

23
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:05,940
about this problem from the
discrete point of view again.

24
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:09,980
So if x were a discrete random
variable, the problem would

25
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:15,310
be, what is the probability that
the absolute value of x

26
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:18,480
is equal to, say, 1/2?

27
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,840
Well, the probability that
the absolute value of

28
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,480
x is equal to 1/2--

29
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:25,090
that can occur in two
different ways.

30
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:28,610
One is that x itself is 1/2.

31
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:32,810
Or x could be negative 1/2, in
which case, the absolute value

32
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:35,030
of x would still be 1/2.

33
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:37,740
So those two events are
mutually exclusive.

34
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:41,460
And so the probability of either
one of them happening

35
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,010
is you can just add them up.

36
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:46,190
And so the probability of the
absolute value of x being 1/2

37
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:50,440
would have two contributions,
one from x being 1/2, and one

38
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,030
from x being negative 1/2.

39
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:54,650

40
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:57,280
The analogous idea carries over
to the continuous case,

41
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,600
when you have a PDF.

42
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,260
So now let's say that we're
interested in the case where

43
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:06,620
we want to know the
PDF of y at 1/2.

44
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:11,680
Well, that again, is going to
have two contributions, one

45
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:18,410
from where x is 1/2, and one
from where x is minus 1/2.

46
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:23,980
And so you can just imagine that
each one of these values

47
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:26,990
for y-- and remember, y has to
be non-negative, because it's

48
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:28,830
an absolute value--

49
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:34,470
has two contributions, one from
the right side of 0, and

50
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:38,490
one from the left, or
negative, side of 0.

51
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,800
So you can come up and write
an algebraic expression for

52
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,670
this, and we'll do that in Part
C. But you can also look

53
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:48,500
at this from a visual
point of view.

54
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:53,570
And you can take the PDF diagram
itself and imagine

55
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:56,410
transforming it to find out what
the PDF of the absolute

56
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:58,220
value of x would look like.

57
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:03,110
So the way to do it would be
you take what's on the

58
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:04,690
negative side.

59
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:08,290
You flip it over and take the
mirror image, and then you

60
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:11,350
stack it on top of what you have
on the right-hand side,

61
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:13,700
or the positive side.

62
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,750
So take this, flip it over,
and stack it on top.

63
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:18,310
You can imagine just taking this
block, flipping it over.

64
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:22,230
And just think of it as like a
Tetris block that's falling

65
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:23,470
down from above.

66
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:26,050
And it stacks on top of
wherever it lands.

67
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:28,520
So it'll turn it into something

68
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,770
that looks like this.

69
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:38,490

70
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:46,490
So there's already a block of
height 1/3 from 0 to 1.

71
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:47,460
That's from the original 1.

72
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:50,530
And now we take this, and flip
it over, and drop it on top.

73
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:56,110
Well, this part is going to
fall on top of the segment

74
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,320
from 0 to 1.

75
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,090
And then this part gets
flipped over and

76
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:01,070
dropped over here.

77
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:03,290
And it falls down here.

78
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:09,610
And so the final PDF actually
looks like this kind of

79
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:15,400
staircase, where this is 2/3
now, because this has two

80
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,640
contributions of 1/3 each,
and this is 1/3.

81
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,839

82
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:26,090
So that is the graphical way
of approaching this.

83
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:37,750
And the PDF for completeness,
the PDF of y would be 2/3 for

84
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:51,440
y between 0 and 1, 1/3 for y
from 1 to 2, and 0 otherwise.

85
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:56,650

86
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:59,615
All right, so let's move
on to part B, and

87
00:04:59,615 --> 00:05:00,540
get some more practice.

88
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:07,210
Part B, we're given that this
PDF of x now is 2 times e to

89
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:10,810
the negative 2x for x positive,
and 0 otherwise.

90
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:14,030
Now you may just recognize this
as an exponential random

91
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:17,100
variable with a parameter
of 2.

92
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,480
And again, we can graph this
and see what it looks like.

93
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,640

94
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:29,240
And it turns out that it's going
to start out at 2 and

95
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,490
fall off exponentially.

96
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:32,520

97
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,990
So in this case, this is
actually quite simple.

98
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:40,280
Because if you look at it,
x is already positive.

99
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,930
It doesn't have any
negative parts.

100
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:46,240
So in fact, the absolute value
of x is the same as x itself,

101
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,070
because x is never negative.

102
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:54,620
And so y is just the
same thing as x.

103
00:05:54,620 --> 00:06:00,360
And so in this case, actually,
the PDF of y is exactly the

104
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,860
same as the PDF of x.

105
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:06,960
It's just 2e to the
minus 2y, for y

106
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,030
positive and zero otherwise.

107
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:16,690
Now you can also see this
graphically also, because to

108
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:20,630
the left of 0, the negative
part, there is no PDF.

109
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,470
The PDF is 0.

110
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:24,460
And so if you were to take this,
flip it over, and drop

111
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:27,090
it on top, you wouldn't get
anything, because there's

112
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:27,590
nothing there.

113
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:32,610
And so the entire PDF, even
after you take the absolute

114
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:35,660
value, is just the
original one.

115
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:42,180
So to generalize, what I said
at the beginning was that,

116
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:50,910
remember, the probability in
the discrete case, if you

117
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,520
wanted the probability that the
absolute value of a random

118
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:59,630
variable equals something,
that would just be the

119
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:04,400
probability that the random
variable equals that value of

120
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:10,160
little x, or the random
variable equals

121
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:15,450
negative little x.

122
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:17,870
In either of those two
cases, the absolute

123
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,400
value would equal x.

124
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,980
So you get those two
contributions.

125
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:24,300
And so to generalize in the
continuous case with PDFs, you

126
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,450
get something that looks
very similar.

127
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:39,790
So in this case, the PDF or y
is just the PDF of x at y.

128
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:48,426
So this is the case where x is
just equal to y, plus the PDF

129
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:50,650
of x evaluated negative y.

130
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:54,700
So you, again, have both of
these two contributions.

131
00:07:54,700 --> 00:08:00,030
And we can rewrite this
top one to make

132
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:03,020
it look more similar.

133
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:08,840
So the PMF of some discrete
[? number ?] y, where this is

134
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,580
a discrete random variable
that's equal to the absolute

135
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:15,760
value of x, would be the PMF of
x evaluated at y, plus the

136
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:19,120
PMF of x evaluated
at negative y.

137
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,790
So in both the discrete and
continuous cases, you have the

138
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:24,040
same thing.

139
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:29,380
So the overall summary of this
problem is that, when you take

140
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:30,070
a transformation--

141
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:31,540
in this case, an absolute
value--

142
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:34,659
you can reason about it and
figure out how to decompose

143
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:37,720
that into arguments about the
original random variable, just

144
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,760
plain old x.

145
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:43,159
And for the specific case of
the absolute value, it just

146
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:47,320
becomes taking a mirror image
and popping it on top of what

147
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,280
you originally had.

148
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,780
So remember, you always have
these two contributions.

149
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,810
And so if you ever have a random
variable that you need

150
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:55,880
to take an absolute value of,
you don't have to be scared.

151
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,790
All you have to do is consider
both of these contributions

152
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:02,982
and add them up, and you have
the PDF that you want.

153
00:09:02,982 --> 00:09:04,232
So I'll see you next time.

154
00:09:04,232 --> 00:09:05,350
