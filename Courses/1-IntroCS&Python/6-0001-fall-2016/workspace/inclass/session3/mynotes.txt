In the discussion about floating points it is important to note that adding 0.1, for 10 times is not the same as 10*.1. This is basically because some rounding has happened in the for loop.
This is worrisome, if we want to test for equality, so one thing to do is to check whether how close they are like abs(x-y) < 1e-10.

Newton-Raphson: proves that if guess is an approximation to the root of a polynomial then guess - p(guess)/p'(guess) is always a better guess (p' is first derivative). This idea is used for "successive approximation".
